# Air Pollution Project
## This was a project, or the first Programming Assignment of the Johns Hopkins
## R course, of the Data Science Specialization path, in Coursera.

#### This assignment consists in 3 exercises, or writing 3 functions.
#### I will describe those functions below.


    1. Write a function that takes some (given) .csv files from a directory,
       and calculate the mean from a specified column, of a given number or
       of files and return the mean of the column/s of one or more files.

    2. Write a function that takes the directory of the .csv files, and the id
       of the files to work on and return a data frame with two columns, id
       (id of files) and nobs (number of complete cases or complete rows).

    3. Write a function that returns the correlation, using cor() function,
       from a collection of files with a given threshold of observed complete
       cases, or complete lines.
